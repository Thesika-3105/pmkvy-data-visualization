# PMKVY Data Visualization (Matplotlib Mini Project)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This mini project analyzes **Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY)** training and placement data across Indian states.  
Using **Matplotlib**, we visualize gaps between training and placement numbers to derive meaningful insights.  

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Source**: Manually curated sample dataset representing state-wise PMKVY data.
- **Fields**:
  - `State` â†’ Indian state name
  - `Trained` â†’ Number of candidates trained
  - `Placed` â†’ Number of candidates successfully placed

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations
- **Bar Chart** â†’ Trained vs Placed candidates by state  
- **Pie Chart** â†’ Placement distribution across states  
- **Line Chart** â†’ Trends in training vs placement  

## âœ… Key Insights
- Training numbers are high, but placements are lower in many states.  
- Some states dominate placements, while others lag behind.  
- Highlights the need for **better industry linkages** in low-placement states.
